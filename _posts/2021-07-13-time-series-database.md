> A time series database (TSDB) is a software system that is optimized for storing and serving time series through associated pairs of time(s) and value(s).[1] In some fields, time series may be called profiles, curves, traces or trends.[2] Several early time series databases are associated with industrial applications which could efficiently store measured values from sensory equipment (also referred to as data historians), but now are used in support of a much wider range of applications. -- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database)
