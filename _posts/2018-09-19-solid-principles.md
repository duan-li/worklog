SOLID is a common acronym in the software development world. Itâ€™s useful to remeber five best practices to design classes in a object oriented language.[^1]

Initial | Stands for | Concept
--- | --- | ---
SRP | Single Responsability Principle | A class should have only a single responsability.
OCP | Open Closed Principle | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
LSP | Liskov Substitution Principle | Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
ISP | Interface Segregation Principle | Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose-interface.
DIP | Dependency Injection Principle | One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
