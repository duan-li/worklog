# Lactation Cookies

## Cookies recipes
* 1 cup **self raising wholemeal flour** (if you have plain flour, add 1/2 teaspoon baking powder) 
* 1/2 cup **butter** (you can use organic virgin coconut oil instead if you prefer) 
* 3/4 cup **brown sugar** (if you want to reduce sugar, you could try just 1/2 cup) 
* 2 tablespoons **flaxseed meal** 
* 1 **egg** 
* 2-3 tablespoons of **water** (depends on how moist you prefer the cookies to be) 
* 1 tablespoon **vanilla extract** (optional, for flavour) 
* 1 teaspoon **cinnamon** (optional, for flavour) 
* 1-2 tablespoons of **brewers yeast** – do not substitute with bakers yeast or any other yeast 
* 1/2 teaspoon **salt** 
* 1 & 1/2 cups **oats** – organic, steel cut oats are best for you, but rolled oats are fine 
* OPTIONAL: 1/2 cup of your favourite biscuit ingredients (see suggested list below) - 


## Method
1. In a large _mixing bowl_, cream the **butter** and **sugar**, then add the **egg** and **vanilla**. Mix well. 
2. In a _separate bowl_, combine the **flaxseed** and **water**, let them sit for a few minutes before adding to `mix`. 
3. Add the **dry ingredients** (apart from the **oats** and your additional ingredients) and mix well again. 
4. Finally, stir in the **oats** and your additional ingredients. 
5. Make the `biscuits` (I use a dessert spoon as a rough size guide) and place them onto _a lightly greased_ or _lined baking tray_. Flatten them a little with your fingers or a spatula – if you like a soft centre, don’t squash them down too much. If you like you can just make them into balls – I do this and I love the soft centre!

Bake the lactation cookies for around **10-12 minutes**, depending on how well cooked or crunchy you like your biscuits. Preheat to 170C or 338F .
